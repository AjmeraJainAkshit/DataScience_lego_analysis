# DataScience_lego_analysis
We walkthrough a data analysis project on DataCamp. This project has us walk through a Lego dataset and answer a few questions. 

From the DataCamp website:
The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, We will get to explore the Rebrickable database and answer a series of questions related to the history of Lego!

Some skills worked on in this project:
- Reading CSV files with Python
- Filtering DataFrame based on conditional parameters
- Grouping data by column values and aggregating it
